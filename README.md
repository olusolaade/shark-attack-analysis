Conclusion and Recommendation
Human Activity Influence: Many shark attacks occur in areas where humans engage in water activities, suggesting a correlation between human presence and incident rates.

Species Specificity: Certain shark species are more frequently involved in attacks, such as great whites and bull sharks, likely due to their size, habitat, and feeding patterns.

Geographical Variability: Attack frequencies vary by region, influenced by factors like water temperature, prey availability, and proximity to migration routes.

Risk Mitigation: Strategies like beach closures, shark nets, and public education programs play crucial roles in mitigating risks and increasing public safety.

Media Influence: The portrayal of shark attacks in media can sometimes exaggerate the actual risk, leading to misconceptions about the true frequency and danger posed by sharks.
